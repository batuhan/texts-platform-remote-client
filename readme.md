# Platform Remote Client

This is the client side boilerplate of remote platform integration for Texts. 
It is made in a way that you only need to update frontend file `auth.tsx` to add whatever is necessary for backend server to handle the requests.

Server side boilerplate at https://github.com/batuhan/texts-platform-remote-server-boilerplate

## Customizing Authentication

For integrations requiring additional user credentials, such as an API key, or username-password pairs, the `auth.tsx` file facilitates easy customization for this data. 

Let's assume you need to add an API Key field.

- Add a new state variable for the new input
```tsx
const [apiKey, setApiKey] = useState("");
```
- Add a new input for the API Key
```tsx
<input
    id="api-key"
    type="text"
    value={apiKey}
    onChange={(event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) =>
        setApiKey(event.target.value)
    }
    style={{ width: "100%" }}
    placeholder="Enter API Key"
/>
```
- Pass the new input to login function. Which will be passed to server.
```tsx
login({ custom: { label, baseURL, apiKey } });
```
